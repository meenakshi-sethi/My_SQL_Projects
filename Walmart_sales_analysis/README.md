**Modifications:**

To focus more effectively on branch-wise sales analysis, several columns were removed from the original dataset:

- **City**: Removed because branch data provides sufficient geographic detail for this analysis.
- **Time_of_Day**, **Day_Name**, and **Month_Name**: Removed since the date and time columns provide the necessary temporal information, and these derived columns were not needed for this specific analysis.

This streamlined dataset allows for a more targeted examination of sales trends, customer behavior, and profitability across different Walmart branches.

### Purpose of the Data
This dataset is used to perform various sales analyses, including but not limited to:
- Analyzing sales trends across different store branches.
- Understanding customer preferences based on demographic factors.
- Identifying top-performing product lines.
- Evaluating the effectiveness of different payment methods.
- Calculating profitability and gross margins.

### Data Source
The data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antaesterlin/walmart-commerce-data).

### Usage
This data can be used for a variety of analyses, including descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and customer segmentation.
